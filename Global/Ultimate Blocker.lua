-- Note: You should always block the player normally as well!

-- Settings! Change these or ultimate blocker will not work!
wait(2.5) -- If the player you blocked is still in game and they are inside the table CORRECTLY then increase this number!

-- Starting values

-- Checks if the player that is blocked is currently in game.
